    "# Interpret Models\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use Azure Machine Learning to interpret a model by using an *explainer* that quantifies the amount of influence each feature contribues to the predicted label. There are many common explainers, each suitable for different kinds of modeling algorithm; but the basic approach to using them is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before You Start\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start this lab, ensure that you have completed the *Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace* and *Create a Compute Instance* tasks in [Lab 1: Getting Started with Azure Machine Learning](./labdocs/Lab01.md). Then open this notebook in Jupyter on your Compute Instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install SDK packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by ensuring that you have the latest version of the Azure ML SDK installed, including the *explain* optional package. In addition, you'll install the Azure ML Interpretability library. You can use this to interpret many typical kinds of model, even if they haven't been trained in an Azure ML experiment or registered in an Azure ML workspace."
