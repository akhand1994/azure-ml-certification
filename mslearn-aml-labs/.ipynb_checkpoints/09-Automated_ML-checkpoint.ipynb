    "# Using Automated Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many kinds of machine learning algorithm that you can use to train a model, and sometimes it's not easy to determine the most effective algorithm for your particular data and prediction requirements. Additionally, you can significantly affect the predictive performance of a model by preprocessing the training data, using techniques such as normalization, missing feature imputation, and others. In your quest to find the *best* model for your requirements, you may need to try many combinations of algorithms and preprocessing transformations; which takes a lot of time and compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Machine Learning enables you to automate the comparison of models trained using different algorithms and preprocessing options. You can use the visual interface in [Azure Machine Learning studio](https://ml/azure.com) or the SDK to leverage this capability. he SDK gives you greater control over the settings for the automated machine learning experiment, but the visual interface is easier to use. In this lab, you'll explore automated machine learning using the SDK.\n",

    "Before you start this lab, ensure that you have completed the *Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace* and *Create a Compute Instance* tasks in [Lab 1: Getting Started with Azure Machine Learning](./labdocs/Lab01.md). Then open this notebook in Jupyter on your Compute Instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important**: The automated machine learning functionality in Azure Machine Learning requires specific versions of some Python packages. These are installed in the **Python 3.6 - Azureml** environment on the compute instance by default, but if you have installed or upgraded any packages in other notebooks, you should run the cell below and then **<u>restart the kernel</u>** before proceeding."
